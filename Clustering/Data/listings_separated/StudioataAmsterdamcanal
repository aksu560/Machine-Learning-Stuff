"A nice studio in the center of Amsterdam at a canal. 30 m2. Small and old but with a typical canal view and close to everything important about Amsterdam. Great location. Centre of Amsterdam, close to Central Station (10 min walk), De Jordaan (the most famous canals) and about 30 min walking distance to everything important about Amsterdam. Great view of a canal and a park. Its an old building with a small staircase and its not 100% dark at night. You will have to ajust a little :).","A nice studio in the center of Amsterdam at a canal. 30 m2. Small but with a typical canal view and close to everything important about Amsterdam.
