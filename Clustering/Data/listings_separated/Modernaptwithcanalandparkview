Overall, I ","Perfectly located and very close to the popular Jordaan district, city center and Museum Square. The neighborhood is very close to the centre, so during the day it has a typical Amsterdam city vibe. In the direct surroundings are shops, supermarkets, coffeebars and restaurants available. There is very little nightlife in the direct surroundings, so quiet during the night. Out of the windows you will see in all directions canals and bridges, which are so typical for Amsterdam with on the otherside of the canal a city parc.
