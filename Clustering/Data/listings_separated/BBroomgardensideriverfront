Yes, we were lucky with this nice house built in 1900 with a quiet, shady garden plus veranda at the back, where we made a private B&B room 'downstairs' (half below street level, what we call souterrain). It is with a double bed (plus an extra sleeping sofa) and a separate private bathroom. The B&B can accommodate two people to four people. This garden side b&b with river frontis a family friendly and offers the following amenities; cable TV and wireless internet. Breakfast is served in our dining room. At the front is the tree -lined Amstel river plus house boats, rowing boats, ducks, flowers....  Yet the Metro is at 150m (4 stops from Central Station), and Amstel Station is at walking distance, or 1 subway - stop. Cars can be parked (paid, no charge on Sundays!) in front.
