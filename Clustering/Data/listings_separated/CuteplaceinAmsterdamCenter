,"***** Welcome to the cutest place in Amsterdam ***** Located in the historic center of the city, only 5 minutes from central station, in one of the best parts of the canal area, by the Amstel river and famous Magere Brug!  This two-room apartment is well maintained and perfect for a couple or 2 friends (it has sleeping possibilities for up to 4 people though).  Everything you need for your stay - wireless internet, washer, a stove, a microwave/oven, linens, a small garden, books and dvds - is included.  Grocery stores, restaurants, cafe's and metro line are next door. Great location: near everything, yet with a peaceful atmosphere. The Carré Theatre, the botanical garden and the amazing Waterloo-square market (which is open 6 days a week) are all around the corner. Do you want to stay longer, shorter or a different date? Don't hesitate to contact me for more info.   Cheers, Kris","***** Welcome to the cutest place in Amsterdam ***** Located in the historic center of the city, only 5 minutes from central station, in one of the best parts of the canal area, by the Amstel river and famous Magere Brug!

Also I love the Amstel river around the corner for evening strolls and water-side picknicks with my boyfriend.","Very convenient public transport: two metro stops around the corner, as well as the tram. Bike rental place 'Macbike' is within a 5 minute walk from here.",It would be great if you could leave the place tidy and clean. Thank you :)
