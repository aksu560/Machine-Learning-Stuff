"Nice little studio (20m²) in the hart of Amsterdam in the swinging 'de Pijp'  area. The studio is perfect for a couple because there is a double bed (140). You can stay completely independent in the studio, there is a small kitchen, bathroom with bath and shower and we can also provide everything you need for a baby (bed, bath, chair etc).","Completely renovated in 2014.  The studio is on the street side of the house.  Kitchen: microwave, coffee machine, fridge and everything you need to have a quick meal. The bathroom is comfortable with a big bath, shower, toilet and double washbasin.  The studio is situated in a very lively area. The ' museumplein' is only 10 minutes walkaway and there are bars and restaurants just around the corner. The daily market ' Albert Cuyp' is on the aralel street, so there is always something to enjoy very nearby.","Nice little studio (20m²) in the hart of Amsterdam in the swinging 'de Pijp'  area.
