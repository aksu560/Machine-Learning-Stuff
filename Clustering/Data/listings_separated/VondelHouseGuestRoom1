A mere 10 minutes walk through the park will bring you to the Museumplein with the Rijksmuseum and van Gogh museum. The neighbourhood is close to the centre, but it is not where the majority of the tourists stay.","The most common transport from Schiphol to the accommodation: 1) at Schiphol you can take a taxi, which is a 20 minutes ride to the apartment OR 2) you take the train from Schiphol to Amsterdam Centraal and then take tram 1 to tramstop ""Jan Pieter Heijestraat (Overtoom)"". This should take approx. 35-45 minutes OR 3) you take the train from Schiphol to the station of Lelylaan (only 1 stop from Schiphol) and then take tram 1 to tramstop ""Jan Pieter Heijestraat (Overtoom)"". This should take no more than 25 minutes from Schiphol. From the last tramstop to the accommodation is only 200m. Your accommodation is part of a 5 storey building.
