Our daughter has a room at the other side of the boat and there is a workshop on this boat but these are private. The bed and breakfast is located in a green and quiet street but only 15 minutes from the central station. The place feels like home away from the crowd after a busy day. The bed and breakfast is easy to reach by tram (tram 26). For cars it is a deadend street with paid parking, as everywhere else in the centre of Amsterdam.
