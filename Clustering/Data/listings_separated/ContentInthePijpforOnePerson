The Center of town is a short walk of 15/20 minutes, or 10 minute tram ride. (The tram is 5 minutes from my door)  I’m a ten minute walk to the Museumplein (square), where you will find the Rijks, Van Gogh and Stedelijk museums. The Albert Cuyp Market, an outdoor market, where you can buy food, clothes, furniture, textiles, and even find a pair wooden shoes, is around the corner.  This is a very international neighborhood, and there is a plethora of restaurants. At the top of my street just is Vietnam pho, Mexican tacos, Indian curry Japanese noodles, Italian pasta. There is a burger palace as well as a vegetarian takeaway, many Thai, Chinese, and Suriname restaurants. Something for everyone. And if you like, you will find Coffeeshops galore.
