Surrounded by canals, boutiques, bars, mini-museums, vintage markets, apple pie, kind faces and lots of bikes you will have a hip, small town feel whilst being in one of the world's coolest cities!","-The tram stop to central station is right around the corner, and you will be there in 9 minutes. -easily connected to all sights by tram.  -bike rental facilities on almost every street corner. There is one at Bloemgracht (100 m) and a couple at Rozengracht (100-500 m)","As this is my own apartment where I very happily live, I won't be able to remove all my stuff for your visit. Please pay respect to my belongings. You're very welcome to read my books or watch my DVDs.  I have a beige couch. If you want to eat on it, please do this with caution :)  Smoking outside please.  I'd prefer to accomodate people with a bit of cultural interest rather than those who are in Amsterdam only for the ""coffeeshops"" or Red Light District.   Quiet on the stairs please. Thank you!"
