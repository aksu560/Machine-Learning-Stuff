With Love Widad ",The apartment is located in a very nice area in Amsterdam  itâ€™s a quiet location but close to the city center and  10 min from Central Station There are some nice restaurants a coffeeshop and a supermarket all within 5 min from the apartment,"The best way to get around in Amsterdam would be a bike, public transportation or uber i recommend if you come by car to park at the nearest park and ride which is located at sloterdijk station",I have one rule. No loud noise after 22:00!!
