It's a comfortable apartment, 60 m2, two bedrooms (3 persons max), bathroom with a rainshower, cosy living and dining area, big balcony.",The apartment is on the third floor which guarantees much light. The living- dining area borders on the balcony. There is a small room included in the apartment as well that I use for storage (therefore there is no picture) but it can be very well used to sleep a child or a baby. ,"This authentic apartment is located in Amsterdam West, 5 minutes walking from the Jordaan.
