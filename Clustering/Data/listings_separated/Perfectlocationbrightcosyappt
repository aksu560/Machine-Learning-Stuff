For families/couples up to max 5 people. fifth floor so lots of stairs :)","Very bright, sunny and cosy 2 floor appartment/penthouse on the topfloor of the building. There's an open kitchen in the living room, a luxurious bathroom (toilet is separated) and a comfortable bedroom with a kingsize bed (220x180). On the second floor of the apartment is the living room with a second (Murphy) bed (140x200). Next to the living room is a outside terrace (both sides).
