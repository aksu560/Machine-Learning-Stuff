Newly refurbished apartment and most happening area of Amsterdam Guests have access to all areas in the house. There is a garden and we have a huge kitchen with a great collection of cookbooks If possible we check you in personally or we ask a friend to do so. We also leave a manual for the house and the area. You will have the place entirely to yourself. The multicultural neighbourhood has a great mix of exotic shops, deli style shops and lovely restaurants and bars. It is also has two beautiful parks nearby and it is easy to take a bike ride into nature, right outside of town. There are plenty public transport options: metro, trams and buses to reach the city center quickly.","The multicultural neighbourhood has a great mix of exotic shops, deli style shops and lovely restaurants and bars.
