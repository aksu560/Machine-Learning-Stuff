I will interact with guests through email or phone. If possible, me or my boyfriend will welcome guests and give them the keys. If we're not available, keys can be picked up at a nearby cafe (they have a lockbox). Our neighborhood is quite trendy and close to the city center but not too crowded. I love it! The tram to and from Central Station stops around the corner. Trams and buses to and from the Dam, Leidseplein and other destinations are also around the corner.",Our neighborhood is quite trendy and close to the city center but not too crowded.

You can use our towels, fridge, tv, etcetera. Just leave the place the way it was when you arrived. Please hang towels in the bathroom  and place dirty dishes in the dish washer. You can leave the key to the building inside the apartment when you check out, and you can lock the apartment door and slide the apartment key under the door afterward. Thanks!"
