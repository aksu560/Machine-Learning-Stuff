Leidsesquare has lots of different cafes, bars and restaurants. However a very good way to explore Amsterdam is by bike. It will only take you 10-15 minutes to the city center. At a 5 minutes walk you will also find a nice park, nice restaurants (cafe Cook, Radijs, Zurich and Bar Baarsch), supermarket and other facilities. Great places to visit are Eye film museum and NDSM werf (i.e. Pllek). Ferries leave behind central station. ",,"Tourist tax in Amsterdam is 5,5% of the renting price. If you liked your stay at my apartment a little tip is of course appreciated."
