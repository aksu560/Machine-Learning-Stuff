The big rooftop terrace is a great place for breakfast/lunch/diner in the sun! A guest bedroom and a study that could be turned into a bedroom if needed.  Guests have access to the private bedroom, bathroom (2), living room, kitchen and  rooftop terrace. We will be present in the apartment but work during the day and have our sports etc during the evenings and weekend. We have a very safe and relatively quiet neighborhood which is very nice for a good night rest! We are close to train station Amsterdam RAI and Amsterdam Zuid. Easy access to public transport, trams stops around the corner. Best way to get around is by bike! Rentals are possible in different shops close by. The apartment is on the third floor, only stairs no elevator. Inside of the house are also stairs, possibly dangerous for children under the age of 3/4 years old.",We have a very safe and relatively quiet neighborhood which is very nice for a good night rest!,"We are close to train station Amsterdam RAI and Amsterdam Zuid.
