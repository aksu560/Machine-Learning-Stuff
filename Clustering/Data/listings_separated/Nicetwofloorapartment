The apartment is located in Amsterdam oud west, a very nice/cosy and popular neighborhood in the centre of Amsterdam.","The apartment is located in the middle of Amsterdam, right next to the newest hotspot of the city 'de hallen' (a 1 minute walk). Besides 'de hallen' the apartment is also very close to the Vondelpark (5 - 10 minute walk) and the museumplein (12 minute walk). The apartment is also very close to the Leidseplein, the biggest entertainment area in Amsterdam (less then 2 km).  With all these areas one walking distance this location is probably one of the most popular areas among tourists and locals.",There is a parking garage right around the corner (however this is very expensive â‚¬ 4 per hour so I would advice not to come by car to Amsterdam). There are three tram stations on walking distance (all in a radius of 500m).,
