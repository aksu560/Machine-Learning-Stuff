"Unique two bedroom apartment in a lovely neighbourhood. The western islands are part of the city centre, but very easy going. The small canals and old bridges are beautiful.  You will have access to the building's private garden.","Although we are located in the city centre, our place is quiet. Since most of our neighbours are families-with-kids, we will be somewhat picky who we allow as a guest.","Unique two bedroom apartment in a lovely neighbourhood.
