How to describe my place in the best spot of Amsterdam? Just come and find out!,"I love my house. Its small, but very light and it feels spacious because of the two floors. It is at the corner of a quiet street, in the centre of Amsterdam, in the heart of the Jordan area. Typical Amsterdam is everywhere around! Johnny Jordaan, the Dutch most famous singer from the Jordaan area, was born in this house. Enjoying Amsterdam starts here :) Saturday market around the corner, 10 minutes walking distance from the Central Station and shopping/red light district. And the Anne Frank house is even closer. The finest shopping street Haarlemmerdijk at 2 minutes and the best view of the Brouwersgracht and Prinsengracht around the corner. Enough places to eat, but the local grocery store also nearby.  My place has WIFI and two sets of doors in the living that can be opened so a small inside terrace is created. It has a separate toilet, and a bath and a washing machine.","How to describe my place in the best spot of Amsterdam? Just come and find out! I love my house.
