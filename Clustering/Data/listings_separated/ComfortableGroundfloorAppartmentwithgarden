Brouwerij het IJ -a mill that serves its own beer, Distillery ''t nieuwe diep' in the Flevopark 5 min. away, Comfort Caff√© for the best Pasta's around the corner, 'Wilde Zwijnen' for the great local foodcreations etc.). Besides that the City centre is a 10 minute bicycle ride away!!!

I expect that you leave the place as you found it...but that speaks for itself. - The most important thing is that I like openess according to communication during your stay. If anything gets broken or so, please communicate about it and we will figure it out. I expect a relaxt, friendly and social attitude from both sides."
