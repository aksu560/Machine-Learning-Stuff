"A spacious home in a neighborhood that is going through a change. Coffee and lunch places are popping up everywhere. Dam square is a 15 minute bike ride away, bars are 5 to 10 minutes away and a big park is just around the corner.",I like this house because we have lots of space. The kitchen is big enough for a fun dinner party. The living room is spacious and blessed with sunlight. We have two bathrooms one of which has an actual bath.,"A spacious home in a neighborhood that is going through a change. Coffee and lunch places are popping up everywhere.

The kitchen is big enough for a fun dinner party. The living room is spacious and blessed with sunlight. We have two bathrooms one of which has an actual bath. You can use all the shared spaces: kitchen, living room and bathrooms. We are 4 people living in this house and we love to hang out from time to time. You are welcome to join if you wish. And as I will not be there when you stay in my room you'll be sharing the house with 3 people. The neighborhood is melting pot of people. There are Turkish stores and brand new coffee and lunch places. The place is changing which makes for an interesting atmosphere. There is a tram stop down the road and the train station is a 7 minute walk away.",The neighborhood is melting pot of people. There are Turkish stores and brand new coffee and lunch places.
