If glasses break, donâ€™t worry. Can happen. Just let us know if we have to replace something.  The apartment is in a residential building and I have a very good relationship with my neighbours. Please be sensible.  The house keys are coded keys, please don't loose them since they are costly. In the exceptional case that the apartment is left in an unclean state, or somebody has been smoking we will have to deduct the extra cleaning costs from the deposit. (We take care of the laundry of course.) Above all: Enjoy your stay!"
