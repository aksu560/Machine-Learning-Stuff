"Cozy studio appartment. Great location, near 4 major tram routes and around the corner from the Kinkerstraat shopping area and the de Hallen food and drink shopping mall. Only a 10 minute walk to Leidseplein, Vondelpark and museumplein (Van Gogh, Rijks & Stedelijk) :)",,"Cozy studio appartment.

Smoking is permitted in the kitchen only,  please leave the door to the living room closed and the window open so the smell doesn't travel."
