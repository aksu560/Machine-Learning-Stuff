Then a couple more bullets which seem common sense but hey you can never be clear enough: SAFETY: No open flames are permitted anywhere in the house. That means no smoking or candle burning. Also, do not make a copy of the house key! PRIVACY: I will show you which room is to be kept private (which means no guests access) and trust that my guests will honor my request. Also "
