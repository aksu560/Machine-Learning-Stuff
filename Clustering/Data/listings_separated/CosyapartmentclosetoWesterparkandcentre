"Bohemian apartment (60m2) in Amsterdam - west (next to the beautiful Westerpark which offers plenty of cultural sides, 20 min walking from the heart of Amsterdam - including central station - and 10 min from the popular Jordaan area). Don't feel like walking? There are busses and trams leaving around the corner, also to central station.  No loud noise after 10 Pm due to neighbours.  Last but not least; a very lovely and accessible place to stay with a sunny balcony :)","Next to a beautiful cultural park with restaurants, bars, micro beer brewery, wine bar, cinema and also plenty of playgrounds and animal farms for kids. Supermarket and bakery is around the corner.","Bohemian apartment (60m2) in Amsterdam - west (next to the beautiful Westerpark which offers plenty of cultural sides, 20 min walking from the heart of Amsterdam - including central station - and 10 min from the popular Jordaan area).
