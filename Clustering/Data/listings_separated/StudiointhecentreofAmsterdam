,"Hi there, Thank you for taking a look at my studio! My place is small but really nice and comfortable. It's close to shops, a market, public transport and within 10 minutes of biking (!!) you are in the middle of the centre (Dam square). Also there are 2 parks close to my house and some nice bars/reastaurants. My house has a small bathroom, a nice kitchen and there is a washingmachine. There is one, 2 person bed. Also there is balcony. If you want more information please contact me. Sorry for the bad pictures. I'm working on it. :)","Hi there, Thank you for taking a look at my studio!
