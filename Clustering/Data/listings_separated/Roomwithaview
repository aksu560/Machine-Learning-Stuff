Clean and spacious single room. Guest can make use of bathroom, the fridge and the kitchen for breakfast, there is free wifi I am a social type, love travelling and meeting new people and happy to provide my guests with additional information about the fun things to do in Amsterdam. View at the water, harbour in front of the house, swimming and BBQ's during summer, a fantastic harbourclub good for wining and dining next to my house, lovely park in the neighborhood, convenience of living in nature within a city. City centrum 10 minutes by bike. Bicycles for rent nearby. Easy acces with metro, bus, tram or bycicle (rental place only at 10 minutes walking distance!) This is not the spot to stay if you want to party and get wasted, in that case I recommend you to look for another place.","View at the water, harbour in front of the house, swimming and BBQ's during summer, a fantastic harbourclub good for wining and dining next to my house, lovely park in the neighborhood, convenience of living in nature within a city.

If you want to enjoy the full party night life of Amsterdam, which I do like too, than I recommend you to book another place."
