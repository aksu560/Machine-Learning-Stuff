If ","Our apartment is in the centre of Amsterdam in the cosy Jordan area (de Jordaan), close to many touristic highlights (the Anne Frank house is only 5 minutes away!). Around the corner are lots of lovely restaurants and bars, every Monday and Saturday there are street markets (including a biological market on Saturday) and there are 3 supermarkets within walking distance.","From Schiphol you can either take a taxi (20-25 minutes, around â‚¬45) or take the train to Central Station (15 minutes). The apartment is just 15 minutes on foot from Central Station. If you prefer to save your feet for all the walking you'll be doing, you can also take tram 13 or 17 from Central Station to Westermarkt (5 minutes from our house).","Just a few simple rules: - Please think of our neighbors - Please only smoke outside on the balcony - No more than 2 guests - Most of all, have fun!"
