,"My brand new 90 square meters apartment is located in an old industrial building in Amsterdam West with a canal on one side and a massive rooftop on the other side. It has one large bedroom, a fully equipped modern kitchen, a large bathroom and a separate washroom. The apartment is tastefully decorated, there is free WIFI, a plasma television and a great sound system. There is one kingsize bed and one large airbed. The place is a 5 minute walk to the most beautiful historic part of Amsterdam called 'de Jordaan' where one finds the best one of a kind (designer)shops, restaurants and small galleries. It will take you about 15 minutes to get to my appartment from Central Station by tram, 5 minutes only by taxi. From Central Station to the airport there is a 20 minute shuttle train to Schiphol Airport.  Upon arrival there will be fresh flowers and I can give you plenty of tips about bars, clubs, restaurants, shops and museums!
