"The historic city center, with all his museums, shops, canals, bars, red light district, clubs and restaurants is within a less then 10 minutes bike/public transport distance.","The apartment is located in Amsterdam Centre, near the nautical museum and Artis, the large Amsterdam Zoo.  A perfect place to chill after a day of sightseeing, on the comfortable couch or enjoying the view on the balcony..","The historic city center, with all his museums, shops, canals, bars, red light district, clubs and restaurants is within a less then 10 minutes bike/public transport distance.","The neighbourhood is relatively quiet and very safe.  In the 17th and 18th century the large ships were produced here for the Dutch United East India Company because of its proximity to the waters of the IJ. Within walking distance you can enjoy the alternative creative bar and city beach Roest, the zoo Artis, the science museum Nemo, lots of nice bars and the rest of the beautiful historical centre only a 10 minute bike ride away.","Public transportation is easy and fast. From Schiphol airport you take the train (15 minutes) to Amsterdam Central Station. From there, bus 22 or 48 will take you to my apartment within 10 minutes. Parking space is available at 3 euro per hour from Monday-Saturday from 9:00 AM-9:00 PM. During the rest of the evening/night and on Sundays parking is free.","The apartment and its neighbours are nice and quiet; I expect my guests to honour this. 'Tiptoeing' is not necessary, but loud music or very loud talking on the balcony after 10:30 PM will not be appreciated. Pets are negotiable."
