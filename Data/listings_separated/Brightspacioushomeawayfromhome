"What not to love about this bright and spacious apartment: two balconies, enough room for 3 (or if you squeeze a bit 4) adults,  a garden, a well-equipped kitchen and bathroom with bath and shower. This creative home is located ideally near two parcs and close to the Jordaan and Westerpark area. Buses and trams stop in front of the apartment and shops, bars and restaurants are all located within 100 meters. Although the home is not child friendly I am happy to host well-behaved furry friends.",,"What not to love about this bright and spacious apartment: two balconies, enough room for 3 (or if you squeeze a bit 4) adults,  a garden, a well-equipped kitchen and bathroom with bath and shower.
