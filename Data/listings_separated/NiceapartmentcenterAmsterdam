,"Hi,  I have a small apartment in the center of Amsterdam. It is all for yourself and it is situated in the center of Amsterdam. It is really quiet inside the house. A lot of nice little restaurants are in the neighbourhood. I am happy to tell you where all the nice places are. It is in walking distance to leidse square (5 min) and other monumental places. Public transport to all relevant other places of Amsterdam is within walking distance (2 min).  A bus from the airport stops really close to the house and a bus near the house is direct connect to the beach (in Zandvoort).  Free WIFI available.   Hope to see you soon, ready to help you, greetz, Ruben","Hi,  I have a small apartment in the center of Amsterdam. It is all for yourself and it is situated in the center of Amsterdam.
