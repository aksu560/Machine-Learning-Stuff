"My comfortable houseboat lies in the middle of nature, at 15 minutes bij bus or bycicle from the Central Station. It has all the modern comforts, like central heating, bath, flatscreen tv, wifi.There's a big garden, free parking, is near a17th century dike and is in Amsterdam north: very quiet and beautiful country nearby.","There's great views of the wide canal, the forest opposite and, ofcourse, the garden. It is very quiet.","My comfortable houseboat lies in the middle of nature, at 15 minutes bij bus or bycicle from the Central Station.

There's great views of the wide canal, the forest opposite and, ofcourse, the garden. It is very quiet. The garden is a shared one, so you can't sit there,but you can sit on the terraces. I'll be in France this summer, but you can always mail or call me. The new filmmuseum EYE is near,  Waterland, with great authentic villages is just around the corner. It's a 5 minute walk to the 17th century dike and one of the oldest pubs in Amsterdam.  Nearby is bus 32, 15 minutes to the Central Station. The country beyond: WATERLAND is very prety and has many byciclepaths. I've lived here for 22 years and still love it! It's very nice and quiet.","The new filmmuseum EYE is near,  Waterland, with great authentic villages is just around the corner.
