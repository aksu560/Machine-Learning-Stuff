I have one two personsbed (this is not on the picture jet) and you can put an airmatress on the ground for a third person. The place is all yours, you can use everything. I am not at home when you are there. There is a every day market and shopping mall around the corner at Plein ’40 ‘45, a nice park and the Sloterplas nearby. Around the corner there are two trams to the centre, and in a few minutes you walk to subway station de Vlughtlaan and to the train station Sloterdijk. Please contact my about the details of you're stay and to make arrangements how and when you can check in.","There is a every day market and shopping mall around the corner at Plein ’40 ‘45, a nice park and the Sloterplas nearby.
