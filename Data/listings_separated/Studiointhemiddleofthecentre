The room/ studio is in the middle of amsterdam. It has a nice new bathroom, a little basic kitchen and you will have your own frontdoor.  You will have access to everything what is in the centre. It is possible to borrow our bikes if we also will be home at the time that you will be here. Otherwise it is really easy to travel by public transportation or to rent a bike. The central station is a 10 minute walk from the house so it is easy to travel around in Holland if you stay in the appartment. The museumsquare and all the touriststuff is not more then 15 minute walks. We are 4 girls who live in the house. A lot of the time during the summer we will be gone. But if we will be home we can help you around in holland. You have your own bathroom, frontdoor",,,"We are a non smoking house, so we will be happy if you smoke outside:). Also we hope you will keep the room as good as it was before your stay."
