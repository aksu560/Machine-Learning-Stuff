"Large and neat two story house in the heart of Amsterdam West with two bedrooms, two balconies and a beautiful roof terrace. The place is ideal for couples, business travelers, or two couples traveling together. The place is in a quiet street and is close to the Amsterdam City Center (10 minutes by bike or public transport), De Jan Evertsenstraat (with many cool shops and people). De School Amsterdam (best night club) is literally crawling distance from the house.",,"Large and neat two story house in the heart of Amsterdam West with two bedrooms, two balconies and a beautiful roof terrace.
