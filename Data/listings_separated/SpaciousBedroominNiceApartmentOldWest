"Great light-filled apartment with roof-terrace in Amsterdam West. Situated in the 'De Baarsjes' neighbourhood, a non-touristic neighbourhood, with nice bars & cafes and close to all amenities (Supermarkets, shops, public transport). The trams nearby run into Centraal/Leidseplein every 6 minutes and you can be in the city centre within 10 minutes. This makes the apartment perfectly located to explore all parts of Amsterdam.",,"Great light-filled apartment with roof-terrace in Amsterdam West.
