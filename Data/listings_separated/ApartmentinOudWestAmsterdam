Very bright and cozy apartment located in Oud-West Amsterdam area (strategically close to the central landmarks of the city while keeping a local and laid-back feel to it). All the amenities inside including 2 bikes put at disposal for guests.,"The apartment is ready for you to just step in and enjoy, everything you need you will find inside (including also 2 bikes put at disposal for guests). The apartment is located in a very lively area, with supermarket, shops and plenty of restaurants and cafes just around the corner.  The area is mostly inhabited by locals so you will get the real Amsterdam feel while also being very close to the central points of the city (it is very close to Leidseplein - 5 to 10 minutes by bike, 15 minutes on foot -, one of the three main squares in Amsterdam).  I hope you enjoy both the apartment and the location as I have myself in the past!","Very bright and cozy apartment located in Oud-West Amsterdam area (strategically close to the central landmarks of the city while keeping a local and laid-back feel to it).
