"Our apartment is peaceful, yet very close to the city center. Lots of space (100m2) and a great garden in an exciting and upcoming neighborhood. A nice way to experience Amsterdam! The new North-South Metro line is a 5 min walk away.","The house is amazing, big, light, has a great garden and is kind of a rural place in the busy city. It's in the North of Amsterdam, a very untouristic area with lots of cool cultural hangouts.","Our apartment is peaceful, yet very close to the city center.

Parking is paid sinc","See (Website hidden by Airbnb) if you want to know why Amsterdam-Noord is the place to be. It has a lot of restaurants, a market and new architecture, such as the Filmmuseum.
