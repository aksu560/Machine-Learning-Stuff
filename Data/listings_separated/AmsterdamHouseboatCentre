On a good day there will be a lot of boats active on the water and you'll feel you are at the most central point of Amsterdam. Living on a boat like this gives you all the comfort (central heating, airconditioning, cable tv, et cetera), but also a feeling best described as 'freedom'. The boat is fixed of course, but the slight movements give you the feeling you are not attached to the rest of the world.","You enter the houseboat from the square directly in front of the 'Stopera'. Down about 5 steps you can go left to a small bedroom (sleeps 2), straight ahead to the rather large bathroom with toilet, seperate bath and shower.
