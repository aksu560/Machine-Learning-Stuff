As can be read in the reviews the bathroom is small. Advantage though is that the toilet and bathroom are seperate rooms. I rent my apartment when I am away myself. However, in this modern times I am always accessible for unexpected issues. Also, my downstairs neighbours are always willing to provide neccessary information. My apartment is situated in the western part of Amsterdam. This area is an upcoming and popular neighbourhood with a lot of restaurants and bars. There are also two supermarkets on only 200m. The Vondelpark (the biggest public park in Amsterdam) is only 500m away. Pu",My apartment is situated in the western part of Amsterdam.
