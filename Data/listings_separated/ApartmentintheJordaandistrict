,"The apartment consists of a living room, separate kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. What can you expect? A quiet place in the hectic city of Amsterdam where you can relax after having  spend the day visiting musea (the new Rijks!!!) and slendering alongside the famouse canals for instance.  My apartment is located in the heart of the Jordaan district, which is  famaouse for always having something to do. Going out to eat or just for drinks shouldn't be any problem  in one of the many restaurants or bars in the neighborhood. If you want to coock youre own meal, the kitchen is well equiped and there are two supermarkets nearby or on a saturday you walk out to the Lindengrachtmarket in front of the house. Public transport is around the corner but Amsterdam Centraal  station is only 15( for me 10) minutes walking.","The apartment consists of a living room, separate kitchen, bedroom and bathroom.
