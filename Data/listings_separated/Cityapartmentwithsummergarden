"Nice apartment within the center-ring of Amsterdam.  Only a 10 minute bikeride away from the city center. This apartment has a beautiful garden with a BBQ to relax on hot summer nights (and days!). Also two cats to make you feel at home.  We have a brand new huge kitchen with big SMEG oven, dishwasher, Nespresso & cappucinomaker , but pictures are not available yet!","Big livingarea with open kitchen. Bedroom with huge  & comfy double bed. Bedroom a small bed for baby or toddler available. And of course a nice garden for lazy breakfast or long summernights. Also, we have two cats and three chickens and we would like to ask you to give them some food every day. But in return, you can eat fresh eggs every day!","Nice apartment within the center-ring of Amsterdam.  Only a 10 minute bikeride away from the city center.
