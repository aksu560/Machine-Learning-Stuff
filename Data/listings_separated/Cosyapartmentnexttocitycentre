Baut is a great restaurant. So is Trouw. Would also totally recommend VolkHotel's bar on the rooftop!! :) my favorite ;) Very good access to public transport.  Metro stop Wibautstraat just around the corner. Tram 3 and 7 pass right next to our place too. Would advise to rent bikes! It's the best way to explore Amsterdam! :-)",I love our area as it has quite a number of nice bars and restaurants. Bukowski is just 2 mins away by foot. Baut is a great restaurant. So is Trouw.
