,"Beautiful and very light apartment in centre of Amsterdam. Very close to the Amstel river, Skinny Bridge, and walking distance from the canals, the famous Albert Cuyp market and Rembrandt plein (Rembrandt Square). The apartment is very light because it is on the top floor and has not only windows on the front and the back but as well in the roof!  It's only 25 meters from a tram stop, and 250 meters from metro stop (4 stops from Central Station).  It is a very nice and cosy place that I think will make you feel home and welcome immediately in Amsterdam!  I am more than willing to give you ideas for great places to go in Amsterdam, like museums, cute areas and streets to stroll around, nice restaurants, bars and clubs.  Hope to see you soon!!","Beautiful and very light apartment in centre of Amsterdam.
