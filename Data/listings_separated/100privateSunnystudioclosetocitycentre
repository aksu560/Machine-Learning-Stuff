This means first of all that we can't give you a 24 hours service. Secondly, we have some house rules that need to be respected in order to make your stay and that of others as comfortable as possible.  For one, we ask our guests to respect each other's privacy.  We much appreciate it if our guests will be careful with the objects in our apartments. Accidents are always possible, but damages need to be paid for. Children's For one child up to 3 years old you don't pay extra, older children's are seen as extra person. Tranquility Please respect each others well deserved sleep and try to be quiet should you come in at a late hour. Check-in/check-out Rooms are ready after 15.00 hrs. Arrivals are possible at any moment during the day, however, only after deliberation with us. If at your time of arrival in the morning the Studio is not yet ready, you can always leave luggage with us and accept the key."
