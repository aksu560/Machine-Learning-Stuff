I've written down some nice places to visit and want you to enjoy Amsterdam as much as I do myself. There really is a lot to do in our neighborhood. The most trendy bars in town are on walking distance, as well as restaurants of all kinds as well. I am pleased to help you find out great (not so touristic) places if you want.

Parking is expensive, but you can park on P+R Zeeburg which is really affordable and take the bus to Beukenplein and walk from there in a few minutes to the apartment. Eventually, we might be able to arrange bikes for you as well, otherwise you can rent them close by. It will be able to walk to a lot of places from the apartment as well, due to the good location.","No smoking inside (no problem on balcony's), no drugs ofcourse. And no pets. We live in a quite neighborhood, so no parties, loud music or yelling at night. Cleaning You donâ€™t have to clean the house when you stay at our place. But we do ask you to leave the house tidy, so that we can start directly cleaning when we arrive. You are staying in our house and not in a hotel, so we expect you to live up to these standards. When needed, you can use the vacuum cleaner (located right in the kitchen behind the basketcase) to clean. For the bathroom furniture we have a special detergent that is located on the top red shelve in the bathroom. When you leave If we are not there to check the house with you, please check if the heating system is turned down low (15 degrees), if all lights, blowers etcetera are turned off and all doors are closed."
