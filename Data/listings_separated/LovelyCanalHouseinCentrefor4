Nice shops, cultural venues ","Possibilities to wine and dine are literally just around the corner. And a large supermarket is at just a 5 minutes walk.  But maybe even more important: A lot of cultural landmarks are at just 5-10 minutes walking distance. For example: the Hermitage, the Rembrandt House, Waterloo Square Market (daily!), the Jewish Historic Museum, the Scheepvaart Museum and the Royal Artis Zoo.  It’s also very close to the Utrechtsestraat (nice shops, bars and restaurants) and Nieuwmarkt. Nightlife is at a 10 minutes walk at the Rembrandt Square.  Maybe it’s good to know original Amsterdam Canal houses mostly don’t have a lift, so you get a free exercise and nice view as a reward ;)! Access from this location is very good. Several trams stop nearby: numbers 7, 10, 14 and 9 are only 5 minutes away. Metro station 'Weesperplein' is also a 5 min. walk! So within 10 minutes you can see all highlights of the city: The Dam, Leidsche Square, Anne Frank House, Red Light District and the famous neighborhood's:",Of course we will leave you a map to help you find your way around the city.
