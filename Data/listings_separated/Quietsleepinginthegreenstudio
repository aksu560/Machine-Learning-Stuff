THere are 48 steps on the staircase before you reach this attic studio. You will have your own private bathroom and fridge. If you want to cook there is a shared kitchen on the first level. We prefer bookings of 3 days or more, up to three days we only accept LAST MINUTE.","A large variety of restaurants and shops are around the corner, there is even an outgoing area where lots of Amsterdam people go out.","Parking is expensive here, come with public transport and move around walking, that is the best way. Bicycles are available in every street but it is a dangerous city to cycle, walking is a lot more relaxing and if you re tired, you hop on a tram.","We don't like rules so much but we appreciate friendly, neat and quiet (URL HIDDEN) far I never had anybody crossing these wishes. We don't charge for cleaning so we appreciate it when you leave the place as you found it. Smokinbg is allowed but please open the windows when you're out. Our heaters work perfectly, it is warm within a few minutes but the cost of electricity and gas is quite high, so turn the heater down when you're out please!"
