Lots of new, small bars, shops and artistic places have been opened the last year(s). You can find a lot of nice trendy bars within 5 minutes of the appartment, and on the square itself you can find a good recenly opened pizzeria. This neighbourhood really has a buzz! On walking distance you can find the Oosterpark, a green spot in the middle of the city: a nice place to walk around and to be 'out' of the city for a while. As well, the Amstel river is nearby and at the riverside you will find some lovely restaurants, terraces and bars. Another advantage of this place is the new shopping centre 'Oostpoort, with various shops and grocery stores.","By tram (5 min walk to the nearest stop, tramline 9) the city centre is about 10 minutes away. By bike (the typical dutch way of transport) it will take you 15 minutes. That's quiet close! There is no free parking available in the neighbourhood (parking price for one day, 25â‚¬)","The ambience in the appartment is easy-going; there is space to do whatever you feel like, but always with respect for the others in the appartment.
