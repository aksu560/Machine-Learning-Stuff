You can leave your car for 1â‚¬ a day (max 4 days) in the P&R if you combine it with  public transport tickets. There is one bus to central station (18) and two trams to the museums (nr 12), dam square (nr 14) and Station Sloterdijk (also nr 12).

We like it very much when guests take off there shoes and use slippers in our apartment. Please do not close the door downstairs with too much noice, the neighbours downstairs can hear this very well."
