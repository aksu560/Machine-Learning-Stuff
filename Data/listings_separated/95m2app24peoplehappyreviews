From Schiphol you can either take a taxi (20-25 minutes, around â‚¬50) or take the train to central train station (15 minutes). From central station you can walk (15 minutes), take a tram (1,2 or 5: stop = 'Spui', you can pay cash inside a bit less than 3 euros per person, 5-10 minutes) or take a taxi (5 minutes; they don't like the short ride though).",There are no specific rules. The apartment will be clean when you arrive so we expect all guests to leave the apartment in a clean and good state.  We do not allow our guests to throw a party whatsoever (we like our neighbors:)) or invite additional people to sleep-over.
