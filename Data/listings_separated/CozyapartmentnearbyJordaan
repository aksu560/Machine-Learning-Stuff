The Westerpark is a public urban park in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The former borough of Westerpark is named after the park, as is the current neighborhood. In 2012 opposite the park, two trains were involved in a head on collision. The verdant space of the former Westergasfabriek gasworks along Haarlemmerweg has become a place for cultural avant-garde businesses and events.","The Westerpark is a public urban park in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
