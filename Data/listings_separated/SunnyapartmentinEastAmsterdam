"Our very spacious apartment is located on the first floor and has everything you need for a Amsterdam stay: a great bed, TV, wifi, an open balcony and lots of windows providing sun light.  The neighbourhood Is really awesome. There are many restaurants, cafes, bars/clubs and parks all within walking distance.  Our place has very convenient access to public transportation for other Amsterdam adventures: the Muiderpoort train station and many trams & buses stop around the corner.",,"Our very spacious apartment is located on the first floor and has everything you need for a Amsterdam stay: a great bed, TV, wifi, an open balcony and lots of windows providing sun light.
