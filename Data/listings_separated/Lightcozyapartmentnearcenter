There are lovely shops, bar's and place to get lunch. When you arrive I'll have a list prepared. The public transport is right in front of my door. You can get a tram which takes 3 minutes to the center. Of course its nicer to walk when the weather is good!","It's a very cute neighborhood, with the Vondelpark two minutes away.
