,"Great private loft, right in the historical center of Amsterdam. Location: 2 minutes walk from Dam Square. 5 minutes walk from red light district 5 minutes walk from Rembrandtplein 10 minutes walk from Central Station 10 minutes walk from Leidseplein Interior: Recently renovated loft with open living area and kitchen, a huge kingsize bed, plus a huge private rooftop terrace right on the same level as the loft. If you bring your matress, you could fit 4 persons.  Facilities (all free of charge of course) Wifi, 2 televisions (one by the bed, one in the livingroom),  DVD player, washing machine, microwave/oven, gas cooker, nespresso machine plus all basic kitchen equipment. Downsides -There's no elevator, so you'd have to walk three narrow stairs every time you go out.  -Being located in the city centre you can sometimes hear noises from outside. However the window to the street is double glassed, so closing that helps a lot. ","Great private loft, right in the historical center of Amsterdam.
