Beautiful, bright apartment, in the middle of the historic center. The apartment is equipped with a washing machine, dish washer, microwave oven and fast, reliable WiFi. The living room and high ceiling bedroom each have three large windows, offering a magnificent canal view. There are no shared spaces. The apartment is yours and yours alone. The apartment is at a 5-10 minute walk from central station and a stone’s throw from Dam Square. Many other attractions are at walking distance, such as the Nine Little Streets, the Anne Frank House, the Begijnhof and the organic market. Walk! You’re in the most beautiful part of the city :)  That said, there’s a bike rental place just around the corner and all trains, trams and buses stop nearby as well. If you feel like cruising the canals: pedal boats are for rent by the hour near the Anne Frank house.
