But also of course for the Vondelpark, that lovely, green haven in the middle of Amsterdam, which is less than 5 min from the B&B. And, not to forget, the Museumplein, where you'll find three of the most famous museums in the world: The Rijksmuseum, 't Stedelijk museum and the Van Gogh museum. It's only a leisurely 15 min walk away (passing by one of the fanciest shopping streets in Amsterdam - the Cornelis Schuytstraat) or 5 min by tram. The Leidseplein (which is where the city centre starts seen from us) is 10 min by bike or tram. And th√© most famous shopping street of Amsterdam (if not Holland), the PC Hooftstraat, with shops as Tiffany, Louis Vuitton and Chanel is also in Oud Zuid, next to the Museumplein. Always nice to wander around a bit.... ","Tram 2 stops practically in front of Petit Paris (nearest stop is 'Amstelveense weg' or else Emmaplein). It will take you to the Museumsquare, PC Hooftstraat, Leidseplein & Leidsestraat, the canals, Damsquare and finally the Central station (or the other way around of course). Besides tram 2 there are several other trams and buses that stop close to the B&B.",
