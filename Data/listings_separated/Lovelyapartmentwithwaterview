"My lovely apartment is at the water in the nice neighbourhood called 'de Pijp'. The Rijksmuseum is 'around the corner'. It's an one bedroom (2 pers bed) apartment and a seperate kitchen.  The bathroom is with the toilet, shower and washbowl.  ","Unique elements of my appartment are the location, close to the rijksmuseum, Vondelpark and the RAI, the great view over the water and it's in the nice area 'the pijp'.  Could be daily if needed or wanted. I really love this neighbourhood because of the nice shops, the Albert Cuyp market and restaurants. It's also close to the city centre, but it's more relaxed up here. Close to my apartment there is a tramstation and busstation. Also train station RAI is walk distance and station Zuid and Amstel are easy to get by bus.","My lovely apartment is at the water in the nice neighbourhood called 'de Pijp'.
