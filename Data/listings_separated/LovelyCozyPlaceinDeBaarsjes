,"I'm renting out my Amsterdam apartment. It can accomodate a couple in the bedroom and one person on the sofa. Its fully furnished and will be cleaned daily while I am away. Easy access to public transport directly into town, very good clubs and bars in Leidseplein area which is only 5 tram stops away :) You'll be given access to my office with a 27"" iMac and WIFI, so you don't even have to bring your laptop!","I'm renting out my Amsterdam apartment.
