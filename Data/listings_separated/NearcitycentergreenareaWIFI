,"Hi traveler, welcome on my page! My apartment is located in one of the new trendy neighborhoods in Amsterdam: De Baarsjes! This green area of Amsterdam is unique with two big parks The Rembrandtpark and the famous Vondelpark and only 10 minutes away from famous areas such as the Jordaan, the Pijp and of course the city center of Amsterdam. In the Baarsjes you can find a lot of bars and restaurants which makes it a very safe and lively neighbourhood.
