It is located at the Southern part of the City center with many many bars, boutiques, cafes, galleries and restaurants. Within walking distance you will find all world famous museums.","How to get there from the airport:  You can take bus 197 that will take you directly to Musuem Square in 20 minutes. From there it is a 7 minute walk to my apartment. Many tram and bus lines stop latterly at our doorstep. It will give you an easy connection to all parts of the city. So taking public transport is easy. However walking from our home to the top and more off the beaten track destinations is much more fun and a beautiful experience. Amsterdam is not big so everything is on walking  distance. The Dam Square, Central Station, Rembrandt square and Leidse square, all is easy to walk, even better â€“ rent a bike from the bike shop next door and explore even more of the city.","Smoking and pets are not allowed. (Smoking only at the roof terrace). Please be considerate of the neighbors. Treat the place as your own and have a great time in Amsterdam! Loss of Keys will result in complete forfeit of the deposit (because all of the locks will need to be replaced!) Also, check in after 9PM is possible, but results in a 25 Euro fee. Only couples."
