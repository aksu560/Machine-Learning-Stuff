Be considerate & respectful. Please, No smoking inside the apartment (of course yes on terrace). Of course, you can invite friends over but it is not allowed to let them sleep over. Parties or pets are not allowed. Rental is calculated accordingly to the number of occupants.  Thanks a lot and enjoy your stay in beautiful Amsterdam. Fran√ßois (Franciscus)"
