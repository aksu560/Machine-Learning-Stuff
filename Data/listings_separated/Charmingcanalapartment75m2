",,,"I have a good relationship with all my neighboors, so please support me in keeping this relationship a good one :) The apartment building construction year is around 1900 and can be a bit noizy quite easily. So not wearing shoes inside the apartment, be easy with any music etc. is much appriciated. I'm not a smoker, so smoking on the balcony and not inside the apartment is much appriciated as well."
