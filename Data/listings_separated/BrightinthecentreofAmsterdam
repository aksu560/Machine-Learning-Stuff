Public tran","This is a fantastic neighbourhood in the centre of Amsterdam but still a good distance from the red-light district and its bachelor parties. The Hermitage museum is 100 metres away, both the Artis Zoo and Horticultural gardens 300 metres away, and the Amstel River is just outside the door. This is also the centre of the canal district, sandwiched between the Prinsengracht and Kaisersgracht. ","There are 5 tram lines running close by, as well as the subway/metro connecting with Centraal Station in under 5 minutes.
